# TPS crime clustering (K-means)

Data source: https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/datasets/TorontoPS::major-crime-indicators-open-data/explore

This project analyzes Toronto's major crime indicators from 2021 to 2024 using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The aim is to understand recent trends with data analysis and use clustering techniques to visualize re-dividing precincts to optimize response time and crime eprevention.

This includes:

- Data cleaning: Removing nulls and unnecessary columns, filtering out invalid neighborhoods.
- Exploratory analysis: Visualizing crime trends by year, category, time of day, and location.
- Geospatial analysis: Mapping crime density and clusters using folium and heatmaps.
- Clustering: Applying KMeans to group crime locations, visualizing clusters and their centroids
